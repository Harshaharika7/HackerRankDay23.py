# 📘 Day 23: BST Level-Order Traversal | HackerRank 30 Days of Code

This repository contains the Python solution for **Day 23** of the *HackerRank 30 Days of Code* challenge, focusing on **level-order traversal** (Breadth-First Search) of a Binary Search Tree (BST).

---

## 🚀 Challenge Summary

- You're required to perform a **level-order traversal** (also known as Breadth-First Search) on a given Binary Search Tree.
- Print each node's value as you visit them from top to bottom and left to right.

---

## 📝 Problem Statement

Complete the `Solution` class by:

- Writing a method `levelOrder(root)` that prints the node values of a BST using **BFS traversal**.
- Use a queue to traverse level-by-level and print each node’s data.

---

## ✅ Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 500
- 1 ≤ Node data ≤ 10⁴

---

## 🔢 Sample Input
6
3
5
4
7
2
1

shell
Copy code

## ✅ Sample Output
3 2 5 1 4 7

yaml
Copy code

## 💡 Explanation

- The BST formed will look like this:

markdown
Copy code
    3
  /   \
 2     5
/     / \
1 4 7

yaml
Copy code

- The **level-order traversal** (left to right, level by level) is:
  → `3 2 5 1 4 7`

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Queue-based tree traversal
- Class & Method encapsulation in Python
- Tree traversal logic implementation

---

## 🛠 How to Run

### Option 1: With Input File
Create a file named `input.txt` with the required input and run:
```bash
python3 bst_level_order.py < input.txt
Option 2: Manual Input
Just run:

bash
Copy code
python3 bst_level_order.py
Then enter input values one by one as prompted.

# 📘 Day 23: BST Level-Order Traversal | HackerRank 30 Days of Code

This repository contains the Python solution for **Day 23** of the *HackerRank 30 Days of Code* challenge, focusing on **level-order traversal** in Breadth-First Search of a Binary Search Tree (BST).

## 🚀 Challenge Summary

- You're required to perform a **level-order traversal** (also known as Breadth-First Search) on a given Binary Search Tree.
  
- Print each node's value as you visit them from top to bottom and left to right.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Complete the `Solution` class by:

- Writing a method `levelOrder(root)` that prints the node values of a BST using **BFS traversal**.
  
- Use a queue to traverse level-by-level and print each node’s data.

## ✅ Constraints
        
        - 1 ≤ T ≤ 500
          
        - 1 ≤ Node data ≤ 10⁴

## 🔢 Sample Input

        6
        3
        5
        4
        7
        2
        1

## ✅ Sample Output

        3 2 5 1 4 7

## 💡 Explanation

- The BST formed will look like this:

            3
          /   \
         2     5
        /     / \
        1    4   7

- The **level-order traversal** (left to right, level by level) is:
  
  → `3 2 5 1 4 7`
  
## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Binary Search Tree (BST)
  
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  
- Queue-based tree traversal
  
- Class & Method encapsulation in Python
  
- Tree traversal logic implementation

## 🛠 How to Run

Option 1: With Input File

Create a file named `input.txt` with the required input and run:

        python3 bst_level_order.py < input.txt
    
Option 2: Manual Input

Just run:

        python3 bst_level_order.py
